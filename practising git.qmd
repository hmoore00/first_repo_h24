## Quarto

Quarto enables you executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.


Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options disables to executable code 

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
